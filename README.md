# Huggeds-Keymode-Converter
A configurable osu!mania keymode converter that can convert any beatmap into a higher keymode

Instructions:

- Customize the config.ini in a text editor like notepad to your liking.
- Copy the .osu files you want to convert into the Inputs folder.
- Run the .exe
- Converts are in the Outputs folder! Drag them back into the beatmap folder and you should be able to play it!

Big Features:

- Ability to automatically change the author (if you plan on uploading converts), HP, and OD of the converts
- 3 different conversion modes (3 more are planned) (The only good one is jack_alternate)
- Customizability in regards to handling jack patterns and shield patterns
- Ability to buff the convert (increase the note density) by a configurable amount
- Ability to customize which lanes from the input chart get mapped to which lanes from the output chart

Thank you for downloading! I just released this. It may be buggy. If you have questions or run into problems, message me on Discord (HuggedToDeath#2456)
