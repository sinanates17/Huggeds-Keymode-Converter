    #STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep to 1 unless you want minijacks EVERYWHERE. I can almost guaruntee setting this to 0 will make converts unplayable.
    #Setting this to 0 while buffing the map might create overlapping notes. Don't do it.

    #This setting ONLY APPLIES if you're using 'jack_alternate' or 'jack_alternate_random' conversion modes

max_shield = 1
    #This is the maximum number of shields (notes after the original LN) allowed in a row from one input column before being forced to switch to another output column.
    #Recommended to keep this at 2 or 1 when converting inverse, and to keep it lower than max_jack

buff= 0
    #This value controls how much extra density is added to the converted map. Must be any value between 0 and 1. 0 = no extra density. 1 = maximum extra density.
    #The smaller unjack_interval is, the more density will be added, because unjack_interval determines how close an extra note can be to others before being considered an unwanted jack.
    #Recommended to keep this value between 0 and .4 and at a non-round value
    #This feature is very poorly optimized. Enabling it will cause the conversion process to take much longer.

[Conversion Keys]
    #Conversion keys tell the converter how to map notes from the input lanes to the output lanes. The rows represent input lanes and columns represent output 
    #lanes. The 1s and 0s tell the converter which lanes on the output keymode a note from the input keymode can map to.

    #This config comes preset with only a select few conversion keys, which are the ones most likely to be used. If you want to do different conversions, you need to type in your
    #own key following the same format as the others.

    #Oh and, this tool only converts keymodes UPWARDS. Converting down gets a little finnicky and I don't see any situations where someone would want to do that anyway.
